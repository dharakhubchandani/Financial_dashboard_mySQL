About the Project:
This project is to showcase the kind of financial reports we can extract using mySQL and how the dashboards can be created in Microsoft Excel and Microsoft PowerBI. The dashboard or the type of analysis done here is similar to what I did in my previous roles. 
Dataset: 
The dataset is about the consolidated financials of ABC Limited. All the numbers and company names, locations are random information. No information is true. The data was created based on certain assumptions to show trends. For example; I assumed the total revenue of 14 companies of XYZ Limited to be 20 million USD and then it was allocated between the companies based on a random assumed percentage.
The dataset could be considered as a dataset of various restaurants, various branches of the company, or various products of any organization. The dataset is a form of consolidated financial report.   
•	Company – The company or entity for which the information is there.
•	Location – Location of the company or entity
•	State – State of operation
•	Month – Month for which the data is corresponding to.  
•	Quarter – Quarter for which the data is corresponding to.
•	PL Head – Heading from Profit and Loss statement. Here, I have focused on 3 headings: Sales, Cost and Profit. 
•	Category – Category is about the breakdown as PL head under various product categories.
•	Budget – Budget for that particular category in a particular month. 
•	Actual – Actual amount for that particular category in a particular month.
•	Salesperson – Who achieved the sales for that product in that particular month.
Steps followed in mySQL Workbench:
1.	Checked Schema Profit_loss_abc.
2.	Created table ‘dataset’.
3.	Imported the datafile in mySQL Workbench. 
4.	Wrote queries to extract various tables that can be used in creating dashboard. 
Dashboard in MS Excel: 
1.	For creating dashboard in excel, I created various Pivot tables and then created charts/graphs for the same. 
2.	Once all the Pivot tables were created, brought the respective charts/graphs in the dashboard sheet. 
3.	Created sparklines, slicers and connected it with the respective pivot tables.
4.	Adjusted the margins, formatted the dashboard with heading.
Dashboard in MS PowerBI: 
1.	Imported the datafile in PowerBI and started creating chart. 
2.	Since the theme in MS Excel is white, I decided to keep a dark theme for PowerBI.
3.	In MS Excel, I used slicers so in MS PowerBI I used dropdown options for Dashboard to make the look of dashboard different.
4.	Once all the visualization was created, I just renamed the charts and adjusted the color theme selection.
